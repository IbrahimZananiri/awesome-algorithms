# Graph

## Data Structure
In graph theory, a graph is a group of nodes called vertices, connected via connections (relationships) called edges.

Edges can be directed, making directed graph, or an undirected graph otherwise.

Edges can be extended to hold weights (e.g. road distance, connection latency, cost). Graphs with such edges are called Weighted Graphs.

## Use cases
- Social networks
- Road networks

## Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search
- [Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm](dijkstra)
- Bellman-Ford-Moore Algorithm
